<p>&#8712Tim Sullins is a 24 year old male who works as a temporary employee for
a large biotech corporation. He is interested in branching out, meeting
new people, and learning new skills.&#8715</p></article>

<p>I was a slacker all the way through high school, and as a result, I had no
    idea what I wanted to do with my life. Fortunately, despite my bad GPA, a
    strong ACT score landed me a very generous scholarship at a private university
    in the area. After a few years of struggling, something finally clicked in my
    head, and I began to take life seriously. I became an excellent student, and
    landed a part time job as a laboratory assistant at the Donald Danforth Plant
    Science Center. I graduated college feeling confident in my abilities and my
    future as a scientist. </p>

<p>My first Job out of college was as a contract worker at Sigma Aldrich. It was
    a very demanding position and I often felt as if I was in over my head. However,
    it turned out to be the perfect position for me, as it required me to develop
    a much stronger work ethic, and it challenged my organizational skills. I loved
    the job as I was able to work with state of the art bioreactor cell culture
    systems. <div style="float:left; margin:1em; width:14em;word-break:break-all"><img src="http://www.globalspec.com/npapics/38/96117_042120085731_ExhibitPic.jpg"

    Unfortunately, the contract occured during a period in which Sigma was being
    aquired by Merk. The aquisition caused budgets to be frozen and subsequently my contract was not
    resigned. </p>

<p>After my period at Sigma Aldrich I worked for a year for a small family owned
    business. My prior experience and my willingness to take the lead on any new
    projects granted me a good deal of respect. However, when I began to interact
    with the owner of the company more, it became clear that our personalities did
    not allow for us to work well together. We often had shouting matches over
    the smallest little things, from who left a lab coat outside of the lab, to
    why the scale was so dirty. I was eventually let go for these personal reasons.
    I like to think that since then I have learned the importance of keeping my
    head low and avoiding confrontation in the workplace, yet I still don't believe
    that I ever would have been able to survive in that environment.</p>

<p>One month after I left Leinco I was offered a contract position at Monsanto.
    I gladly took the role and I have never been happier. I work with some of the
    kindest and smartest people that I have ever met. My contract is up in September
    and I am hoping to be either extended or hired.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of a job in the biotech field has left a sour taste in my mouth.
    I love what I do, and I love the people that I work with. However, many in the
    field have found themselves stuck in a never ending cycle of temporary employment.
    For this reason, and because I have always been fascinated by computers, I am
    now attempting to become a skilled programmer. I love learning to program and
    I feel that it will make me more marketable as a potential employee. I am
    enormously grateful to have been allowed the opportunity to participate in the
    launchcode program. </p>
