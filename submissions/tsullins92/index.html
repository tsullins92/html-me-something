<p>I was a slacker all the way through high school, and as a result, I had no
    idea what I wanted to do with my life. Fortunately, despite my bad GPA, a
    strong ACT score landed me a very generous scholarship at a private university
    in the area. After a few years of struggling, something finally clicked in my
    head, and I began to take life seriously. <div class="reactor_pic"><img src="http://www.globalspec.com/npapics/38/96117_042120085731_ExhibitPic.jpg"

    I became an excellent student, and landed a part time job as a laboratory
    assistant at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. I graduated college
    feeling confident in my abilities and my future as a scientist. </p>

<p>My first Job out of college was as a contract worker at Sigma Aldrich. It was
    a very demanding position and I often felt as if I was in over my head. However,
    it turned out to be the perfect position for me, as it required me to develop
    a much stronger work ethic, and it challenged my organizational skills. I loved
    the job as I was able to work with state of the art bioreactor cell culture
    systems. Unfortunately, the contract occured during a period in which Sigma was being
    aquired by Merk. The aquisition caused budgets to be frozen and subsequently my contract was not
    resigned. </p>

<p>After my period at Sigma Aldrich I worked for a year for a small family owned
    business. My prior experience and my willingness to take the lead on any new
    projects granted me a good deal of respect. However, when I began to interact
    with the owner of the company more, it became clear that our personalities did
    not allow for us to work well together. I eventually left the company for a
    temporary position at Monsanto.</p>

<p>My experience working at Monsanto has been amazing. I work with some of the
    kindest and smartest people that I have ever met. My contract is up in September
    and I am hoping to be either extended or hired.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of a job in the biotech field has left a sour taste in my mouth.
    I love what I do, and I love the people that I work with. However, many in the
    field have found themselves stuck in a never ending cycle of temporary employment.
    For this reason, and because I have always been fascinated by computers, I am
    now attempting to become a programmer. I love learning to program and
    I feel that it will make me more marketable as a potential employee. I am
    enormously grateful to have been allowed the opportunity to participate in the
    launchcode program. </p>
